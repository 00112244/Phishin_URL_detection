# Phishing URL Detection Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting phishing URLs using machine learning techniques. Phishing URLs are designed to trick users into revealing sensitive information such as passwords and credit card numbers by mimicking legitimate websites. Our model aims to accurately identify these malicious URLs, enhancing online security.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare URL data for analysis.
- **Feature Extraction**: Identify key features from URLs, such as domain properties and URL patterns.
- **Model Training**: Train machine learning models on the extracted features.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assess model performance using standard metrics.
